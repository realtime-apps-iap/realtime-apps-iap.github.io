Let's explore some browser-side APIs. To do that in a safe environment, create an empty directory, and then empty web page in that directory and call it `index.html`

```html
<html>
    <body></body>
</html>	
```

and serve the page locally (you can use whatever server you like, but we'll use `serve` here)

navigate to the directory containing `index.html` and run

```
serve -p 8080
```

this serves the static web page on port 8080.

Now you can crack open your developer tools and try running / modifying these code snippets!

### Notifications (Desktop)

```js
Notification.requestPermission()
.then(() => {
    new Notification("This is a Notification!")
})
.catch((e) => {
    console.log(e)
});
```

### GeoLocation (Desktop / Mobile)

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((g) => {
    console.log(`Your current position is latitude: ${g.coords.latitude}, longitude ${g.coords.longitude}`)
});
```

### Vibration (Mobile)

You will need Chrome on both your Desktop and an Android Device for this to work.

- First, [set up remote debugging on your Android device.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging)
- Then, open chrome on your Android device and go to `chrome://inspect/#devices` on your desktop
- Click on the **Port Forwarding** button and enable port forwarding. Map port `8080` to `localhost:8080`
- In the **Open tab with url** text box, enter a URL and then click **Open**. The page opens in a new tab on your Android device and click **Inspect** next to the URL you just opened.

```js
window.navigator.vibrate(200);
```

This should cause the device to vibrate for 200ms. If not, check the vibration settings!

Try this snippet out!

```js
window.navigator.vibrate([100,100,100,100,100,100,300,100,300,100,300,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]);
```

Sound familiar? That's the morse code for [SOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS)! i.e. the only notable pattern I could come up with.

Note: Remember to set the site settings back to what they were before after you're done with the exercises!

### Media Capture & Streams API (Desktop / Mobile)

Now, insert a `<video>` element into `index.html` file with an id of `video` so it looks like this:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<video id="video"></video>
         <style>
             #video {
                 border: 1px solid black;
                 max-width: 100vw;
                 max-height: 100vh;
             }
         </style>
	</body>
</html>
```

Remember to reload your server afterwards!

Now we can try this snippet out:

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({audio: false, video:true})
.then((stream) => {
	const video = document.getElementById("video");
	video.srcObject = stream;
    video.play();
});
```

### Screen Capture API (Desktop)

This works very similarly to the Media Capture and Streams API. We can use the same setup for `index.html` as above, but with the following snippet

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({audio: false, video:true})
.then((stream) => {
	const video = document.getElementById("video");
	video.srcObject = stream;
    video.play();
});
```
