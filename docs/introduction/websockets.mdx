## WebSockets Concepts

> A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

#### WebSockets vs HTTP

Let's try to understand WebSockets by looking at the limitations in the HTTP protocol. 

- HTTP is a request-response protocol - the client sends a request message to the server, the server returns a response message.
- Now, what if the server wanted to send messages without being prompted by a request message from a client? There are a few hacks that have been employed using HTTP to deal with this:
  - Short Polling - client makes HTTP requests at a fixed delay
  - Long Polling - client makes HTTP request, server waits for the maximum amount of time allowed before responding, client makes another HTTP request, and so on.
  - Both of these methods incur a bit of network bandwidth overhead. More importantly, they're abusing HTTP functionality to achieve the desired behaviour!

WebSockets addresses this problem essentially by creating and maintaining a two-way connection between the client and the server over TCP. Some features of WebSockets:

- Full-duplex connection, meaning that the client and server can both send data along the connection at the same time. 
- Data is sent as discrete messages. Message data has to either be in a string (USVString), or some kind of binary data type (`ArrayBuffer, Blob, ArrayBufferView`). More Details: [MDN - WebSocket.send()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send)
