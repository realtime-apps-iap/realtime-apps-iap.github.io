title: Competition Info
---

We will be holding an application development compeitition at the end of the workshop
to allow participants to make use of their real-time apps knowledge and create interesting app projects  
Everyone from all technical backgrounds are welcomed to participate!! üòä
(We are not looking for the "most technical" project)

## Aim of Competition üí°

For this competition, we want participants to create an app project that they can include as a worthy front-facing portfolio project for themselves.

You are free to **explore in any direction you are interested in**. As long as you meet the requirements below, there are no limitations to how you want develop your project. You can do anything you want!  
Make this project shine! ‚ú®

## Judging ‚öñÔ∏è

Our judging is intentionally left more vague and open-ended because we want you to create a project that you like and is proud of.  
As long as you have met the requirements below, your project will be accepted.  
Take note of the scoring rubrics as this will be how we judge the projects fairly across the projects.

### Judging Panel:

To be updated...  
(There may be guest judges, maybe profs, industry ppl, etc hehe... This will be a good chance for you to showoff and extend your network)

### Scoring üíØ

Each judge will give up to 30 points for each project.

#### 1. Creativity (10 points)

You have the **freedom to decide what is Creative and Innovative**.  
Creativity can be in terms of functionality, practical useful applications, aesthetic appeal, refreshing experience, etc.  
To aid in judging, please include in your documentation what you think is creative about your project.
The judges will keep an open mind and score accordingly don't worry.

#### 2. Documentation (10 points)

In projects, it is important to have good documentation to help viewers understand your project easily - both from the standpoint of a developer wanting to try the project and a person simply viewing your project.  
The minimum form of documentation we require is a **README.md** file at the root of your project.

Some considerations:

- Quality of documentation
- How well the project is explained & illustrated
- Shows how to set up the project well
- Instructions are clear
- Any technical considerations?
- etc.

#### 3. Workability (10 points)

Many a times, people will not set up and try your application. What they know of your project, is what they can easily see and interact with.  
As such, having a front-facing demo app that is simple to access and use is very important.  
Think from the perspective of you wanting to create this as a project that you want to include in your portfolio for others to view (your friends, recruiters, etc). It needs to have a good degree of workability for them to understand this project fully.

Some considerations:

- Application deployed (e.g. heroku, netlify) and can be accessed easily
  - If the application you have created can't realistically be deployed easily, are there alternative ways you can try your best to present it well?
- Application works smoothly & looks good.
- Users know how and what to do when they access the project.
- Users understand the project well at the end of interaction.
- etc.

### Requirements ‚òëÔ∏è

These are just some basic requirements of the project:

- Project can be done solo or in teams of at most 2 people.
- Public repository on GitHub
- Started development no earlier than the first day of workshop
- There are realtime components to the application
