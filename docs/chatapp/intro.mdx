## Objectives
We want to build a group chat room with the following behaviour:

when a user enters the room:

- user is assigned a random username
- admin-bot sends a message to the everyone in group to welcome the user
- user is added to display of online users

when a user sends a message:

- run a profanity check on the sent message (think about the kids that might see it!)
- if there is no profanity, send the message to the group
- if there is profanity, admin-bot sends a message to the user notifying that the message was not sent.

when a user leaves the room (disconnection):

- admin-bot sends a message to the everyone in group to indicate that the user has left the room
- user is removed from display of online users

In addition, in the users display and the chat messages we also want:

- to display the user's origin country (which we find out by checking the IP addresses) alongside their username.
- to update the number of active users currently in the chat
