In this simple tutorial, let's go through how we can deploy a Python application on Heroku with use of Heroku's **Procfile**

### Set up Python App

For this tutorial, I will use a sample python streamlit application - a [mushroom classifier application](https://github.com/realtime-apps-iap/mushroom-classifier-app)

> Streamlit is a popular python application for data science enthusiasts to host their datascience projects!

```
git clone https://github.com/realtime-apps-iap/mushroom-classifier-app
cd mushroom-classifier-app
```

This git repository is already initialised and tracked, so we don't have to `git init` it

### Create Procfile

Define a worker process - to start the website  
Create a `Procfile` at the root of the repository (already created in the git repo)

```
web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py
```

> Over here, I ran sh setup.sh before running the streamlit application, for some configurations purpose.

> You can add more worker processes if you want with `nameOfProcess: commands`

### Adding Heroku

1. Create Heroku application

```
heroku create
```

To check if heroku is added to your git repository (you should see heroku)

```
git remote -v
```

To check the heroku apps you currently have

```
heroku apps
```

2. Rename the created heroku application

```
heroku apps:rename <newname> --app <oldname>
```

> When you first create the heroku app, a random name will be given, you will have to rename it yourself

OR if you already created a heroku application on the heroku website, you can link it directly

```
heroku git:remote -a <nameofherokuapp>
```

### Test Heroku App

Test the heroku application locally before we push it to heroku remote

```
heroku local web
```

> This runs the web process (that was defined in Procfile) and checks it locally
> You can test and run multiple processes too

Open your localhost at specified port. This will be how it will behave on heroku web.

### Deploying code

1. Push code to heroku

```
git push heroku main
```

> main or master branch

2. Open Heroku website!

Open the heroku website at < app name >.heroku.com!
