In this simple tutorial, let's go through how we can deploy a React application (create-react-app) on Heroku

> React.js is one of the most popular frontend library micro-frameworks which I believe many groups are using. So, let's go through how we can deploy this very easily!

### Set up React App

We can just start off with the template create-react-app

```
npx create-react-app sample-app
cd sample-app
```

Let's initialise this as a git repository as we will need this later, as we will be using git to deploy to heroku

```
git init
```

### Adding Heroku

1. Create Heroku application

```
heroku create
```

To check if heroku is added to your git repository (you should see heroku)

```
git remote -v
```

To check the heroku apps you currently have

```
heroku apps
```

2. Rename the created heroku application

```
heroku apps:rename <newname> --app <oldname>
```

> When you first create the heroku app, a random name will be given, you will have to rename it yourself

OR if you already created a heroku application on the heroku website, you can link it directly

```
heroku git:remote -a <nameofherokuapp>
```

### Test Heroku App

Test the heroku application locally before we push it to heroku remote

```
heroku local
```

Open your localhost at specified port. This will be how it will behave on heroku web.

### Deploying code

1. Push code to heroku

```
git push heroku main
```

> main or master branch

2. Open Heroku website!

Open the heroku website at < app name >.heroku.com!
