## Objectives

We want to build a location-sharing application, that allows users to create and join rooms where they can share their live locations. For this, we need the following behaviour:

when a user enters the application:

- user is able to enter their display nickname
- user is able to enter the ID of the room they want to join
- user is able to choose to either create a new room, or join an existing online

when a user creates a room:

- user is added to the room
- user is given the details of the room (room ID, number of active users)

when a user joins a room:

- user is added to the room
- user is given the details of the room (room ID, number of active users)
- all other users in the room receive the details of the newly arrived user (id for internal app use, display name, current location)

when a user updates their location

- all other users in the room receive the details of the user with updates(id for internal app use, display name, current location)

when a user leaves the room:

- all other users in the room receive the details of the leaving user (id for internal app use, display name, current location)

when in a room, all users are able to see each others locations, displayed on a map.

For reference:
